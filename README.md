## How to use my code

With my code, you can:
* **Train your model from scratch** by running **bash train.sh**
* **Test your trained model** by running **bash test.py**

## Trained models

You could find DDQN model at **model/DDQN**  
You could find DQN  model at **model/DQN**
 
## Requirements

* **python 3.6**
* **pygame**
* **cv2**
* **pytorch-1.0**
